Please respond thoroughly (at least two sentences for each question) to
the following three questions.

1. Describe an experience you had this semester where you saw the power of
functions.

While working on an assignment at the beginning of the course, I encountered many problems.
At first, I wrote everything in one long chunk of code, and it got really confusing. 
But then I split it up into many functions and it felt way more organized, and if I needed to fix something, I didn’t have to go digging through a ton of code. 
That’s when I really saw how helpful functions can be.

2. In your judgment, what is the value of test functions?

I think test functions are super helpful because they make sure your code is actually doing what it’s supposed to do. 
There were times when I thought my code was perfect, but when I ran a test function, I found little mistakes I didn’t even notice. 
It’s way better to catch those bugs early instead of finding out later when something breaks. 
Test functions also save time in the long run because you don’t have to manually check everything over and over again. 
Once you write the tests, you can keep using them to make sure your code still works after you make changes.

3. Describe your process for troubleshooting and fixing a program that
has a problem. What is one thing you can do to improve your process?

When I run into a problem in my program, the first thing I do is look at the error message to see if it tells me what line the issue is on. 
If it’s not clear, I start printing out values at different points in the code to see what’s actually happening. 
That usually helps me figure out where it’s going wrong. Sometimes I even go back and re-read the instructions to make sure I didn’t miss anything.
One thing I could do to improve is to use test functions more often instead of waiting until something breaks. 
That way, I can catch mistakes earlier and not waste time digging through everything.
